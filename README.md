# Catapult
Drupal 7 and 8 starter theme. The D8 version depends on core's Classy theme
where the D7 version is stand alone. The idea is to fork this project and rename
the theme to be your own.

## Getting Started ##

This project depends on Node.js, Gulp.js, and Bower to compile SASS. To start
run the following command from the project root:

`npm install`


## Commands ##
Once you have all the dependant plugins installed you can run any of the
following commands to compile your CSS.

- `gulp (default for 'gulp watch')`
- `gulp watch`
- `gulp sass`
- `gulp sass:production`
- `gulp clean:css`
- `gulp lint:sass`
