# Catapult
Drupal 8 Starter Theme based on Classy from core. The idea is to fork this 
project and rename the theme to be your own. There aren't any fancy Drush or 
Console commands for starting your own (yet).

## Getting Started ##

This project depends on Node.js and Gulp.js to compile SASS. To start run the 
following command from the project root:

`npm install`

If you need to install Node please visit https://nodejs.org/en/

## Commands ##
Once you have all the dependant plugins installed you can run any of the
following commands to compile your CSS.

- `gulp (default for 'gulp watch')`
- `gulp watch`
- `gulp sass`
- `gulp sass:production`
- `gulp clean:css`
- `gulp lint:sass`
